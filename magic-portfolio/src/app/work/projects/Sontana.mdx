## Overview

Development of a flexible and highly customizable design system using React and Vite for front-end and Figma for design collaboration.

## Key Features

- **Modular Component Library**: Developed a collection of reusable UI components using React and Tailwind CSS, prioritizing a "utility-first" approach for maximum responsiveness and speed.
- **Dynamic Theming**: Implemented a flexible styling system using Tailwind configuration, allowing for seamless customization of color palettes and typography that aligns with modern design standards.
- **Firebase Integration**: Built with a Firebase backend to handle real-time data and authentication, ensuring a scalable and production-ready infrastructure.
- **Modern Development Workflow**: Leveraged Vite for an ultra-fast development experience and Vercel for automated, continuous deployment (CI/CD).

## Technologies Used

- **React & Vite**: For building a high-performance, reactive user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid UI development and maintaining a consistent design system.
- **Firebase**: Utilized as the primary backend-as-a-service for database and hosting needs.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The core language used for logic and component functionality.

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge was ensuring that the utility-based styling of Tailwind CSS remained organized and scalable as the component library grew. By establishing a clear folder structure and naming convention, I learned how to bridge the gap between rapid prototyping and long-term code maintainability. Integrating Firebase also provided valuable experience in managing real-time data syncs within a React lifecycle.

## Outcome

The result is a lightweight, high-speed web application that serves as a solid foundation for further development. The project demonstrates a successful integration of a modern front-end stack with a serverless backend, resulting in a cohesive user experience and a highly efficient deployment pipeline.
