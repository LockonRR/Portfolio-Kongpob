## Overview

A comprehensive mobile redesign of the Maejo University registration system (REG MJU) aimed at modernizing the user experience and improving accessibility for students on the go.

## Key Features

- **Modular Component Library**: Developed a suite of reusable UI components including login forms, slide-up navigation menus, and schedule cards using Atomic Design principles in Figma.
- **Design Token System**: Established a centralized system for colors (university-specific greens like #4CA771 and #C0E6BA), typography, and spacing to ensure seamless translation into code.
- **Mobile-First Navigation**: Optimized the user flow for one-handed operation through a slide-up menu architecture and intuitive layout adjustments for essential tasks like checking grades and schedules.
- **Enhanced Information Architecture**: Streamlined the home screen to prioritize high-frequency actions such as news updates, login, and course searching, reducing the number of steps for the end user.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: Primary tool for UI/UX design, prototyping, and maintaining the Design System.
- **React & Tailwind CSS**: Used as the technical foundation for translating design tokens into a responsive, utility-first front-end codebase.
- **Figma Dev Mode**: Utilized for precise design-to-code handoffs, ensuring CSS properties and layout values remain consistent across platforms.

## Challenges and Learnings

A significant challenge involved distilling the complex data of a university registration system—such as detailed schedules and academic records—into a clean, mobile-friendly interface. This required mastering Responsive Design techniques and utilizing Component Variants in Figma to handle various user states. The process improved my understanding of how to balance high-density information with visual clarity.

## Outcome

The project resulted in a high-fidelity prototype that significantly bridges the gap between design and development. By establishing a clear design-to-code pipeline, the workflow minimizes manual UI adjustments during the build phase, ultimately creating a more cohesive and efficient digital experience for MJU students
