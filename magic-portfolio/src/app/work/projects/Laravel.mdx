## Overview

A full-stack web application developed as a modern blogging platform, featuring a robust backend and a reactive front-end interface for seamless content management.

## Key Features

- **Full-Stack Architecture**: Built using a monolithic approach with Laravel as the core engine, utilizing Inertia.js to bridge the gap between the server-side backend and a modern React frontend.
- **Interactive UI/UX**: Designed a responsive and dynamic user interface with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a smooth, single-page application (SPA) experience without full page reloads.
- **Content Management System (CMS)**: Implemented secure CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for blog posts, allowing users to manage content efficiently through a structured database.
- **State & Data Synchronization**: Leveraged Inertia.js for efficient data routing and state management between the Laravel controllers and React components.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel (PHP)**: Used for backend logic, routing, and database management.
- **React**: For building a fast and interactive component-based user interface.
- **Inertia.js**: Used to connect the Laravel backend with the React frontend seamlessly.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid, utility-first UI styling and responsive design.
- **MySQL**: Utilized for structured data storage and management.

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge of this project was mastering the Inertia.js workflow to ensure seamless data flow between the server-side logic and client-side components. This experience significantly improved my understanding of Full-stack development, specifically in managing routing and authentication across a hybrid architecture. I also refined my skills in designing relational databases to support scalable content structures.

## Outcome

The Webblog project serves as a functional and scalable platform that demonstrates proficiency in both backend and frontend technologies. It highlights the ability to build sophisticated web applications that offer both the reliability of Laravel and the high-performance feel of a React application.
